# AutoLattice

AutoScatter is an efficient tool to automatically discover lattice models with desired transport properties. 

In this repository, we will soon publish our codebase. In between, check out our article: \
[Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10693) \
*Jonas Landgraf, Clara Wanjura, Vittorio Peano, and Florian Marquardt* (2025)
